                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>This past summer, I was fortunate enough to have a remote internship at one of the country’s most prestigious E-discovery providers. Upon begging the internship, the team was seeking to upgrade their Two-Factor-Authentication from simple SMS/Email to a more powerful and secure form of authentication.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My first project with Relativity was to explore a customer requested feature called FIDO2. FIDO2 – Fast Identity Online 2 – is a cutting-edge form of authentication which uses quantum Public/Private key cryptography to allow users to authenticate without needing a password. Oh, did I also mention that it is completely unphishable? Yeah, FIDO2 is the real deal!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The concern for the implementation arose from the fact that FIDO2 was developed for .NET Core, while Relativity’s product is .NET Standard implementation. To start, I developed a .NET Core IdentityServer4 flavor of FIDO2 implementation to familiarize myself with the technology, and afterwards created a similar implementation in IdentityServer3 using .NET Standard, the stack that Relativity’s product uses. It worked like a charm!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, because Relativity’s product was built as a monolithic solution as opposed to microservices, when I migrated the solution from the POC, there were an overlap in package dependencies that prevented the serialization of FIDO2 requests, and ultimately prevented a production implementation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After taking this POC to completion, I joined the team and performed ticket work to modernize Two-Factor-Authentication to support modern authenticator apps such as Microsoft or Google Authenticator using Aurelia.js, a Single Page Application (SPA) framework.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because the team mostly had a background in C# as opposed to my background in JavaScript, I quickly became the Team SME (Subject Matter Expert) for all things JavaScript. I was given the added responsibility of developing a Unit-Testing Framework for these new pages. I worked in Karma and Jasmine to create a Unit-Testing framework that was able to test the non-SPA implementation of a SPA framework and achieved a code coverage of 90%
