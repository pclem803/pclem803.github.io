                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>In an Agile Methodology class, I worked on a team to build a web/mobile shopping cart application for roomates and families to coordinate shopping</p>
                
                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
                <p>&#8226; Collaborated with four students in Agile Sprints to develop a shared shopping list web and mobile application in React.js</p>
                <p>&#8226; Devised workflow for integrated user payment utilizing receipt scanning and user notification using Twilio SendGrid API</p>
                <p>&#8226; Built an adaptive frontend interface, including controlled forms, using React, React Native, and RBX component library</p>
                <p>&#8226; Handled sensitive user profile and shopping list data using OAuth2 protocol for login and Firebase JSON-databasing for storage</p>
                
                <!-- <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>With this project, I had three goals: improve as a frontend programmer, learn all about data structures and graph algorithms, and create a portfolio project that looked visually great.</p>
                <p>To program the (resizable) grid, I maintained a 2d structure of interconnected nodes. The application has the ability to add/remove walls on click, move around the start/finish position on drag, visualize graph traversal algorithms, and generate mazes in real time.</p>
                <p>Doing all of this required many different data structures (graphs, linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (A*, Dijkstra’s, Greedy Best First, Depth and Breadth First Search).</p>
                <p>I included 2 main maze generation algorithms: recursive division and another algorithm I designed myself. Recursive division produces perfect mazes, which are mazes in which there's only one solution to get from any one point to another. This is similar to lots of published maze generation algorithms. But, I wanted an algorithm that produced random looking mazes: mazes with loops and large empty sections and inacessible parts and more. I wanted mazes that resembled something closer to real life. So I designed it myself.</p>
                <p>The following is a maze produced from recursive division:</p>

                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>I developed a web-based calendar application where users can create accounts, add items to their calendar, and be notified about upcoming events</p>
                
                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
                <p>&#8226; Created a fully-featured calendar application with custom event types, multiple view panes, and automated email reminders using the Twilio SendGrid API</p>
                <p>&#8226; Built RESTful APIs to handle client JSON requests using a Node.js Express server hosted with Heroku cloud compute</p>
                <p>&#8226; Secured client-server communication with JSON authentication tokens stored through browser cookies	</p>
                <p>&#8226; Stored user profiles, salted passwords, and data on a NoSQL MongoDB Atlas cluster</p>
                
                <!-- <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>I entered university as a journalism major and didn't switch into Computer Science until the end of my freshman year. Feeling like I was behind all my peers, I resolved myself to catch up with them over the summer. The result was InstaMessage.</p>
                <p>Prior to starting the project, I had 0 experience with web development, having never touched even HTML. Thus, at the time, the challenge felt immense. After 2 weeks of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and another 2 weeks of figuring out websockets, Node.js, and CSV files, I came up with my first iteration of the application: InstaMessage v1.0</p>
                <img src='../assets/old_instamessage.png' class='description_image'></img>
                <p>Though the application looked ugly, it worked. Coming from nothing, it felt like a big accomplishment. But, I knew that I wasn't done. The changes from v1.0 to v2.0 were immense. First, I learned about RESTful APIs to handle user logins and used JSON web tokens an browser cookies to authenticate every request to the server. Second, I replaced vanilla websockets with socket.io, an application that was much easier to use and built with powerful add-ons on top of plain websockets. Third, I switched from using CSV files to store messages to MongoDB. Finally, I gave the entire website a visual overhaul, requiring me to write lots of the code from scratch, though it was worth it, as that first iteration of code was not at all well written.</p>
                <p>After another few weeks (by this point, sophomore year had started), I finished the application and released it using AWS to host the server and a free hosting site to manage all the frontend code. The first picture right below the project title is what v2.0 looked like.</p>
